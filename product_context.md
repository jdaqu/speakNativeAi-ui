# SpeakNative AI – Business Context

## Overview

Non-native English speakers working in professional environments often rely on ChatGPT (or other LLM apps) to:

* Fix grammar in their texts.
* Translate messages.
* Check if an email or message is written correctly.

While these tools help in the moment, the corrections and vocabulary are rarely saved. Users miss the opportunity to **learn from their own mistakes** and build long-term improvement.

**SpeakNative AI** solves this gap by combining the convenience of instant AI corrections with personalized learning paths.

## Problem

* Checking English through ChatGPT requires opening the app, writing a prompt, and pasting the text — it’s slow and repetitive.
* Users only “fix” texts but don’t systematically improve, since corrections aren’t tracked.
* Existing apps for English learning often use generic content, not the user’s *own real mistakes and vocabulary*.

## Solution

SpeakNative AI provides a **fast, integrated way** to check English while simultaneously building a personal learning system.

* **Instant Check (≤30s):** Users can quickly correct grammar, translate phrases, or check vocabulary without friction.
* **Automatic Tracking:** Every correction, translation, and vocabulary lookup is saved.
* **Personalized Learning Path:** The app generates practice materials based on:

  * The user’s own mistakes.
  * Vocabulary the user is actually exposed to.
  * Grammar patterns that the user struggles with.

## Value Proposition

1. **Save Time:** No need to manually prompt ChatGPT — corrections are 1-click.
2. **Learn Naturally:** Users learn from their *own writing and mistakes*, not from generic examples.
3. **Personalized Path:** Every user gets a unique study plan automatically created from their interactions.
4. **Dual Benefit:** While fixing texts for work, users are also improving long-term English skills.

## Target Users

* Professionals in non-English countries who work in global environments.
* Students writing in English for academic purposes.
* Anyone who frequently writes in English but lacks confidence in correctness or style.

## Vision

Turn everyday English usage (emails, messages, translations) into **automatic, personalized learning paths**, helping non-native speakers not just “sound correct” — but actually **become more fluent over time**.
